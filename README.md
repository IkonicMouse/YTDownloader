# YTDownloader
YTDownloader Is a program I made because I was bored and wanted to downloader a Youtube video but didn't want to go to a Website each time.

Installation:
1. Click on "YTDownloader.exe"
2. Click on the Button with Three Dots (If you hover over It, It should say "More file actions")
3. Lastly, Click on the Download Button
4. Wait for It to Download
5. Run "YTDownloader.exe" (If you're scared there's malware You can check the Source Code)
6. a Terminal window will pop-up Prompting you to enter a Youtube Video url. you do this by going to your selected Youtube Video, clicking on the url bar on the top of your screen, then when it's selected, either right click then copy or press CTRL + C.
7. Now, go back into the program, and then all you have to do Is just paste in that youtube url With CTRL + V and then press enter
8. Wait for the download to finish..
9. Check Your Downloads folder. you should see the video that you just entered Into the program.
10. Done!
